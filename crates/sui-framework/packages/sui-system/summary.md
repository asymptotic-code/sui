# Sui System (Staking & Validator Management) — Project Summary

## What this protocol does

The `SuiSystem` Move package (`sui_system`, address `0x3`) implements Sui's
on-chain proof-of-stake and validator-management logic. It owns the global
`SuiSystemState` object (fixed ID `0x5`), drives epoch transitions, manages the
active/pending validator set, custodies delegated stake, distributes staking
rewards, draws down the stake subsidy, and accounts for the storage fund. It is
the economic heart of the network: every stake, unstake, validator join/leave,
and reward payout flows through it.

## Versioning model

`SuiSystemState` (the `0x5` object) is a thin versioned wrapper. The real state
lives in `SuiSystemStateInner`, stored as a dynamic field keyed by version.
`sui_system.move` holds the public entry surface and forwards to
`sui_system_state_inner.move` via `load_inner_maybe_upgrade`, which migrates the
inner object to the latest version on access. Upgrades add a new
`SuiSystemStateInnerVN` type plus a migration function; `create` always returns
the genesis type.

## Main modules

- **`sui_system`** — Public/entry surface on the `0x5` wrapper. Thin delegations
  to the inner object: `request_add_stake`, `request_add_stake_mul_coin`,
  `request_withdraw_stake`, `request_add_validator`, `request_remove_validator`,
  validator metadata setters, report/un-report, and the privileged
  `advance_epoch` (system-address only).
- **`sui_system_state_inner`** — Core protocol logic: holds the `ValidatorSet`,
  `StorageFund`, `StakeSubsidy`, parameters, and report records. Implements
  `advance_epoch` (the epoch-change state machine: collect gas/storage, compute
  and distribute rewards, draw subsidy, rotate pending validators, recompute
  voting power).
- **`validator_set`** — The set of active validators plus pending
  additions/removals and a table of inactive pools. Routes stake to the right
  validator, aggregates rewards, adjusts stake, and recomputes voting power at
  epoch boundaries.
- **`validator`** — A single validator: metadata, its `StakingPool`, commission
  rate, gas price, and pending stake/withdraw bookkeeping. Wrapped via
  `validator_wrapper` (`ValidatorWrapper`) for versioned storage.
- **`staking_pool`** — Delegated-staking accounting for one validator. Mints
  `StakedSui` on stake and burns it on withdrawal using a pool-token exchange
  rate (`PoolTokenExchangeRate`) that tracks the SUI-per-pool-token ratio across
  epochs. Also supports `FungibleStakedSui`. `MIN_STAKING_THRESHOLD = 1 SUI`.
- **`stake_subsidy`** — A `Balance<SUI>` drawn down on a schedule; the
  per-distribution amount decays by `stake_subsidy_decrease_rate` (basis points)
  every `stake_subsidy_period_length` distributions.
- **`storage_fund`** — Holds `total_object_storage_rebates` (invariant: equals
  the sum of on-chain object storage rebates) and a `non_refundable_balance`.
- **`voting_power`** — Assigns each active validator a voting power in basis
  points; `TOTAL_VOTING_POWER = 10_000`, with a per-validator cap to bound
  influence.
- **`validator_cap`** — `ValidatorOperationCap` / unverified variant: capability
  authorizing validator operations on behalf of a validator address.
- **`validator_wrapper`** — Versioned `Validator` storage wrapper.
- **`genesis`** — One-time network bootstrap of the initial system state.

## Key data structures

- `SuiSystemState` (key, `0x5`) → wraps `SuiSystemStateInner` (dynamic field).
- `ValidatorSet { active_validators, pending_active_validators,
  pending_removals, staking_pool_mappings, inactive_validators,
  validator_candidates, ... }`.
- `Validator { metadata, voting_power, staking_pool, commission_rate,
  next_epoch_* pending changes, ... }`.
- `StakingPool { activation_epoch, sui_balance, rewards_pool,
  pool_token_balance, exchange_rates: Table<epoch, PoolTokenExchangeRate>,
  pending_stake, pending_total_sui_withdraw, pending_pool_token_withdraw }`.
- `StakedSui { pool_id, stake_activation_epoch, principal: Balance<SUI> }` —
  the user-held staking receipt; principal cannot drop below 1 SUI.
- `PoolTokenExchangeRate { sui_amount, pool_token_amount }`.
- `StorageFund`, `StakeSubsidy`, `PoolTokenExchangeRate` as described above.

## Core invariants / properties of interest

- **Exchange-rate accounting**: pool-token ↔ SUI conversions are monotone and
  consistent; `token_balances` always match the recorded exchange rate
  (`ETokenBalancesDoNotMatchExchangeRate`). Rewards increase SUI per pool token,
  never decrease principal owed.
- **Stake conservation**: SUI moved into/out of a pool equals the change in the
  pool's `sui_balance` + `rewards_pool`; no SUI is created or destroyed except
  via reward inflow and subsidy.
- **Minimum stake**: a `StakedSui`'s principal never drops below
  `MIN_STAKING_THRESHOLD` (1 SUI); withdraw amounts are non-zero.
- **Pool/validator matching**: stake operations target the correct pool
  (`EWrongPool`, `EWrongDelegation`); no staking to inactive pools
  (`EDelegationToInactivePool`).
- **Voting power**: per-validator voting power respects the cap and the active
  set sums to `TOTAL_VOTING_POWER = 10_000`.
- **Storage-fund invariant**: `total_object_storage_rebates` equals the sum of
  per-object storage rebates; only the non-refundable portion is retained.
- **Subsidy decay**: the distribution amount decays by the configured rate each
  period and is bounded by the remaining subsidy balance.
- **Authorization**: `advance_epoch` is callable only by the system address;
  validator operations require the appropriate `ValidatorOperationCap`.
- **No unexpected aborts**: arithmetic on balances, exchange rates, and voting
  power stays within `u64`/`u128` bounds under valid preconditions.
